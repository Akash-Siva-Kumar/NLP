    "# Exploring techniques for NLP\n",
    "As we mentioned in the lecture slides, the different approaches used to solve NLP problems commonly fall into three categories: \n",
    "- rule-based, \n",
    "- machine learning, and \n",
    "- deep learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will try to show you how to use rule-based approaches to solve NLP problems. You can open the cloud version of this notebook using the following link:\n",

    "## Rule-based technique\n",
    "Similar to other early AI systems, early attempts at designing NLP systems were based on building rules for the task at hand. This required that the developers had some expertise in the domain to formulate rules that could be incorporated into a program. Such systems also required resources like dictionaries and thesauruses, typically compiled and digitized over a period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions (regex) are a great tool for text analysis and building rule-based systems. A regex is a set of characters or a pattern that is used to match and find substrings in text. For example, a regex like <b><font color='maroon'>â€˜^([a-zA-Z0-9_\\-\\.]+)@([a-zA-Z0-9_\\-\\.] +)\\.([a-zA-Z]{2,5})$â€™</font></b> is used to find all email IDs in a piece of text. Regexes are a great way to incorporate domain knowledge in your NLP system. For example, given a customer complaint that comes via chat or email, we want to build a system to automatically identify the product the complaint is about. There is a range of product codes that map to certain brand names. We can use regexes to match these easily."
